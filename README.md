### Hi there, it's good to see you here ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© Vinicius Targino Muniz, I am a Computer Technician and majoring in Systems Analysis and Development!

## Experience as a developer:
I worked for 7 months on an internship for an internet provider in Rio Grande do Norte, GTNET, as a back-end developer in php. 
Along with that, I also developed a game as a final project for the Technician in Informatics.
## Future:
I intend, in the near future, to work with game development or as a software creator as a back-end developer.
## Hobbies:
While I'm not coding, I like to watch anime and play different games.
